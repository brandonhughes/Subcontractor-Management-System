## Purpose
This document outlines the rules and guidelines for AI assistance when working on this project.

## General Guidelines
1. Always reference the requirements document to ensure work aligns with project goals
2. Update requirement statuses when completing related tasks
3. Follow established code patterns and conventions
4. Prioritize security and data protection in all implementations
5. Be concise in responses unless detailed explanation is requested

## Code Implementation Guidelines
1. Follow the tech stack specified in the requirements (React/TypeScript frontend, Node.js/Express backend)
2. Use proper error handling for robust code
3. Add appropriate comments for complex logic
4. Implement proper validation for all user inputs
5. Write code that adheres to best practices for performance and security

## Project Organization
1. Maintain clean separation between frontend and backend code
2. Organize components logically based on functionality
3. Follow RESTful API design principles
4. Use consistent naming conventions throughout the project

## Database Guidelines
1. Design schemas with proper relationships and constraints
2. Implement efficient queries that scale well
3. Use appropriate indexing strategies
4. Ensure proper data validation at the database level

## Testing Guidelines
1. Write unit tests for critical functionality
2. Ensure API endpoints are properly tested
3. Test edge cases and error handling
4. Validate data integrity across operations

## Documentation
1. Document all major components and their interactions
2. Keep API documentation up-to-date
3. Document database schema changes
4. Maintain clear and concise code comments

## Security Practices
1. Implement proper authentication and authorization
2. Sanitize all user inputs
3. Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
4. Follow OWASP security guidelines
5. Never store sensitive information in plaintext

## Before Completing Any Task
1. Review the requirements document
2. Check if the implementation matches the project architecture
3. Verify security considerations have been addressed
4. Ensure code follows established patterns
5. Update the relevant requirement status in the requirements document

## After Completing Any Task
1. Update the SUMMARY.md document with:
   - Date and task name
   - Detailed list of completed work
   - Status updates for requirements
   - Recommended next steps
2. Ensure the summary follows the established format in SUMMARY.md
3. Maintain chronological order of entries
